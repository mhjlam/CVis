# Viskom
Implementations of several computer vision techniques: volumetric reconstruction, object tracking, image classification.

## Viskom?
A play on the Dutch word for fishbowl, "vissenkom", and also on Computer Vision, swapped around, abbreviated, and using a K instead of a C. As a happenstance, this repository is used as a showcase for computer vision techniques, very much like how a fishbowl "showcases" fish.
